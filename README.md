# Wine Quality

Developed Wine Quality prediction model using two distinct Linear Regression models. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and leveraged techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction. Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) achieving an RMSE score of 0.199. Demonstrated expertise in regression modelling and data analysis.

### Step 1 : import all the following from the list

		- import pandas
		- import numpy
		- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		- from sklearn import linear_model
		- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder label_quality = LabelEncoder()

### Step 2 : Create a folder Wine, Save the Wine.ipynb in the same folder along with the following files 

		- wine_test.csv
		- wine_train.csv

### Step 3 : Run the Jupyter Notebook Server by just typing “jupyter notebook” on terminal.


### Step 4 : Open the folder Wine and Run the Wine.ipynb
